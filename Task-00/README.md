# Task - 00 Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]

I have installed zorin os as my linux distro because i saw on google that this was the best easiest distro of ubuntu for beginners switching from windows. I actually faced many problems as i wasn't familiar with linux terminal and commands. I just kept going through google and learnt some basic commands. I used more and more terminal in order to learn commands and git.
